탐스러운 체리가 들어 있는 체리 생크림 케이크를 만들었어요~
체리를 작게 잘라 끓여 과육은 크림에 넣고 과즙은 글레이즈에 넣어 만들었는데 색이 예쁜 것 같아요~
크림에 체리가 들어 있어 체리 향과 살짝 씹히는 체리 과육이 정말 맛있더라구요~
그냥 생크림 케이크 보다 과일을 넣은 생크림 케이크가 저는 훨씬 맛있고 풍미가 좋아 선호하는 편이에요~
생 과일을 크림에 넣으면 물이 생길 수 있어 끓여 넣으면 과일 본연의 맛을 즐길 수 있으면서 모양도 잘 유지할 수 있는 것 같아요~
앙증맞은 체리를 올려 장식하니 심플하면서도 포인트가 되더라구요~
장식에 사용한 잎사귀는 집에 있는 커피나무의 잎사귀를 씻어 장식했어요~

wangjs,Hi everyone! As soon as I saw this recipe I just had to try out and went grocery shopping to buy everything I needed. And I’ll just say a couple things to this recipe. - If you don’t have white food coloring it’s fine. Just red food coloring works as well. - you should definitely use baking powder or your cake will turn out very flat and thin.!!! - you might need more heavy cream and sugar than the recipe tells you. For me it definitely wasn’t enough and I couldn’t cover up the top like in the video. Therefore you’d need more cherries too.. I can’t say how the cake tastes yet since it’s in the fridge but I’m really looking forward to try it out.✨🍒,0개,2020. 6. 2.
