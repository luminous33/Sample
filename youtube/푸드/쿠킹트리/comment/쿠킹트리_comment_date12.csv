RuiziaCLyrics,"I tried it. I expected a lot so I was a little disappointed, even if it is still good. What disappointed me was the absence of the taste of oreo.
I will do this recipe again but with a few modifications: I will add a tiny bit of cocoa powder (to slightly reinforce the taste of chocolate) and I will add a little sugar (very slightly) to enhance the taste a little.
I will not dip the cooked churros in cinnamon sugar either: it removes the taste of oreo even more and the sugar does not stick to the churros. Maybe I'll wait for them to cool and sprinkle with icing sugar ...

I am (and will remain) a subscriber to this channel. This is not at all a criticism but more an alternative for those who were not won over by the original recipe. I find this channel very inspiring!

With love

(I used google translation)

Je l'ai essayé. Je m'attendais à beaucoup donc j'ai été un peu déçu, même si ça reste quand même bon. Ce qui m'a déçu c'est l'absence du goût d'oreo.
Je referai cette recette mais en faisant quelques modifications : je rajouterai un tout petit peu de poudre de cacao (pour renforcer légèrement le goût de chocolat) et je metterai un peu de sucre (très légèrement) pour relever un peu le goût.
Je ne tremperai pas non plus les churros cuits dans du sucre à la cannelle : ça éloigne encore plus le goût d'oreo et le sucre ne colle pas aux churros. Peut-être que j'attendrai qu'ils refroidissent et saupoudrai de sucre glace...

Je suis (et restera) une abonnée de cette chaîne. Ce n'est pas du tout une critique mais plus une alternative pour ceux qui n'ont pas été conquis par la recette d'origine. Je trouve cette chaîne très inspirante !

LanaMKong,"Omg are you a mind reader?? 
I was searching for a baked Oreo churros recipe for so long and was hoping you’d make one after I saw your baked churros one~ Thank you so much for this! It looks amazing, I’ll definitely try making them! 💕💕

Edit: Just made them! Gosh, it was delicious~ (Even my parents, who are not big fans of Oreos liked them lmao)
Really crispy outside, airy and light inside. Perfect sweetness level! They didn’t have a very strong Oreo taste, but I prefer it like that. 
Left them a bit more in the oven so they would get crispier (my oven is weird)
Made 4/5 of the recipe since where I live they sell Oreos in packs of 4, ended with around 20 churros the size of my index finger.
