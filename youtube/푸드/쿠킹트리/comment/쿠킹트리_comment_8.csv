맛있는 연유 크림을 넣어 돌돌말은 폭신한 롤케이크를 만들었어요~
시트를 말기 전 연유를 살짝 바르고 말아서 더 촉촉하고 연유 맛도 더 많이 나서 훨씬 풍미가 좋더라구요~
시트가 정말 폭신하고 부드러워 롤로 말기에도 좋고 입안에서 사르르 녹는 느낌도 정말 좋았어요~
윗면의 구움색도 예쁘게 나오고 매끈하게 갈라지지 않고 잘 말아지더라구요~
심플하지만 정말 맛있어서 자꾸만 먹게 되는 롤케이크랍니다~

215,TaeKook,"I made this too but 2 mins after taking it out the oven it started getting hard and crumbly starting from the edges and the cake was not thick at all it was on the thin side so i dont know if its because of the thinness of it ?? 

Other comments say it crumbles because of thickness so im confused",0개

224,Lucky,Amateur baker from UK... Made this today and it turned out really good. The sponge is light and soft and just melts in your mouth. It did crack a little bit when I rolled it out but nothing that will keep me awake at night. 10/10 from me!,0개

244,Thihny,"I dont think you used heavy cream. And yes fresh milk cream... heavy cream does not turn into a hard cream (at least it is almost freezing when you hit/mix it)... 
and yes, I tried it with heavy cream, but it turned into a milk consistence, didnt become hard.. so when I put it on the roll cake, it fell out of my cake hahahaha... disaster",0개
