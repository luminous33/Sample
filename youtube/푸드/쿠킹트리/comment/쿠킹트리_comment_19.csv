2,BnhNguyn,"So tasty! I had tried it and turned out very well! Thank you!
Note: If you don't have cake flour, you can mix all-purpose flour with cornstarch in the 3:1 ratio. That means with 80g flour in the recipe, you will need 60g of all-purpose and 20g of cornstarch.

Whip until a rich ivory-colored foam with a hand mixer, then sift through the flour and baking powder and mix.  3.  Put a little bit of dough in a bowl mixed with melted unsalted butter and milk (temperature 50 ~ 60 degrees), mix, put into the main dough, mix, pour into a muffin mold and air bubbles.  4 .  Bake and cool for 20 minutes in an oven preheated to 170 degrees.

224,PaulinaZepeda,"Does anyone know if there's another way of knowing when to stop heating the yolk mixture? I have quite some experience in baking, but I don't have a thermometer ☹️",1개
225,RifaZanira,"This might be late but to help anyone who read this: If you don't have thermometer to check on the temp, just dip your finger into the mixture! It should be lukewarm temp like, just slightly warm (not hot!) and you're good to go. The heating (40°) is there to help you dissolve the sugar (especially when you use coarser sugar) and to rise the eggs mixture quicker when you mix it.

I hope this helps and good luck! 💕",5개
