114,Eliana,"1.  Gently loosen the unsalted butter, add sugar, whip thoroughly, add egg yolk and vanilla extract and mix.  2 .  Add milk at room temperature and mix, sift through the flour and baking powder.  3.  Whip the egg white, and when a large bubble rises, divide the sugar into 3 and whip it to form a meringue with soft horns, and divide it into the dough 3 times and mix.  4 .  Divide the dough into 3 pieces, add cocoa powder in one place and dark cocoa powder in the other, and mix to make two different types of chocolate dough. 5.  Put the thick chocolate dough in the mold, flatten it, put the light chocolate dough on it, flatten it, pour the vanilla dough, flatten it, and bake it for 45-50 minutes in a 170-degree preheated oven.
