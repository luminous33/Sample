상큼하게 정말 맛있는 노오븐 레몬 치즈케이크를 만들었어요~
중간에 넣은 레몬 커드가 상큼하면서도 쫀득한 식감이 나서 치즈케이크 맛과 정말 잘 어울리네요~
치즈케이크에도 레몬 제스트를 넣어 은은한 레몬 향이 나서 더 상큼하게 즐길 수 있답니다~^^
레몬 과육을 살짝 끓여 위에 투명하게 굳혀 마무리 했는데 레몬의 청량한 느낌과 잘 어울리는 것 같아요~
레몬을 끓이지 않고 그냥 사용하면 너무 시고 잘 굳지 않을 수 있어 꼭 끓어 사용해야 좋답니다~
만들어 먹었던 치즈케이크 중에 top3 안에 드는 정말 맛있는 케이크 인 것 같아요~~

Beautiful cake 👍

I saw you mentioned 5g gelatin but when you pour it in the mixture, gelatin was in liquid
Means you mix gelatin powder with water ? If yes, how many water you put in 5gr gelatin powder ?
And how many water in other 2gr gelatin ?

Or you use liquid gelatin instead of powder ?

Thanks for your explanation

188,SedNonSatiata,I would definitely make this! The lemon curd in the middle is similar to what I make in lemon bars. The only thing is I don't think it was a good idea to add the raw lemon slices to the top. It's not really edible and I don't like adding inedible elements to a food. Then you have the ugly way it all got pulled out from the top when they were cutting into it with the fork. Other than that this looks delicious and I can't wait to try it.,0개
