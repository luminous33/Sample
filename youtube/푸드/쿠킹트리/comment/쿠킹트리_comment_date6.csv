AmericanJank,"I tried this at home, took about 5 hours (cleanup is included in that time) :) 
Heres the American instructions:
-4 eggs
-1 tsp of vanilla extract
-1/4 a cup of sugar
-1/4 tsp of salt
-3 & 1/2 cups of cake flour (I couldn't find cake flour at Hyvee so I made my own: Pour out 3 & 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour into a  bowl, remove 7 tablespoons and add 7 tablespoons of cornstarch. Whisk together, then sift 5 times. I learned when sifting, to our bowl of flour into a sieve owner a Large bowl or the flour will escape, than pour that flour back into the small bowl, than pour over sieve into large bowl again.)
-2 cups of milk
-5 tablespoons of unsalted butter (so a bit over half a stick)
-Red and white food coloring
-2 cups of Heavy cream 
-1/3 a cup of strawberry jam
-Cooking oil (for pan)

Suggestion: For the heart mold, I suggest getting one from the store and not using a cookie cutter or than you will spend a long time on a cake and only have a tiny cake :( get one that's about 6 inches across and 3 inches high)",16개,2020. 5. 22.
