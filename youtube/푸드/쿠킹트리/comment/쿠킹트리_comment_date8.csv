맛있는 연유 크림을 넣어 돌돌말은 폭신한 롤케이크를 만들었어요~
시트를 말기 전 연유를 살짝 바르고 말아서 더 촉촉하고 연유 맛도 더 많이 나서 훨씬 풍미가 좋더라구요~
시트가 정말 폭신하고 부드러워 롤로 말기에도 좋고 입안에서 사르르 녹는 느낌도 정말 좋았어요~
윗면의 구움색도 예쁘게 나오고 매끈하게 갈라지지 않고 잘 말아지더라구요~
심플하지만 정말 맛있어서 자꾸만 먹게 되는 롤케이크랍니다~

AliceYoon,Made this today and it turned out pretty good! If you want more cream in your roll cake I would make a little more than she does in this recipe. Only problem I had was the “skin” kind of peeled off of mine so no pretty brown top 😔 other than that it was really yummy and not too difficult 👌🏽,0개,2020. 5. 19.
