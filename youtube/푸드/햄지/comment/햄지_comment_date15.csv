햄지Hamzy,"첫입 2:30, Start eating 2:30 
중간까지는 너무 맛있었는데 그 이후로 면이 불어서 
뻑뻑했어요😭😭😭물김치 고민하다가 꺼내놨는데 
안꺼냈으면 큰일날뻔했어요 ㅋㅋ
(저는 불닭볶음면이나 짜장라면할때 물을 조금만
버리고 촉촉하게 하는편인데 다른음식 하는동안에 
좀 쫄았나봐요ㅠ)
 
※ 음식을 남기는것에대해서 말씀해주셔서 
답변을드립니다.
 
1.남겨도 안버리고 촬영안할때 다 먹고있어요
(이틀 6끼중 한끼만 촬영하는거에요)
 
2. 조금만 차려놓고 드세요~라는 댓글을 가끔씩
보고있어요. 물론 조금만 차려서 먹을수도있지만 
평소에 먹는대로 정말 조금씩 차려놓으면 
먹음직스러워 보이지가 않기 때문에 말씀하신분들도 
아마 영상을 안봐주실꺼에요ㅠ
(그리고 가끔은 조금씩 만들기가 더 힘든 음식들이 
있어요ㅠ)
