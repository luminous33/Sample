0,햄지Hamzy,"요리 영상만 따로 올려달라는 요청이많아서 
만들어봤어요~!! 
조금서툴고 볼품없지만 제가 만들고 먹었던 요리들을 좋아해주셔서 감사합니다😭😭😭
지금까지 영상들중 배달음식이나 간단한라면같은 
요리들을 제외하고 선정했는데도 갯수가 너무많고, 
제 영상들이 모두 4k로 촬영된거라 영상한개당 
원본파일이 8기가가 넘어서 고화질로는 편집하지 
못했어요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
그점은 양해 부탁드립니다❤

※ 광고 자동으로 해놓은거에요~~~
(평소에 10~13분짜리 영상 업로드할땐 제가 임의로 
2개 넣고있어요~ 오늘은 몇개가 들어갔는지 어디에 들어갔는지 알수없어요ㅠ)
 
※요리파트가 너무짧거나 라면이나 반 조리 제품처럼 요리라고 할수없는것들은 대부분 제외했어요~ 
(가장 최근영상들도 제외했습니다)
 
※ 예전엔 요리보다 먹방 위주로 편집을 했었는데 
최근엔 요리영상을 좋아하시는분들이 더 많으셔서 
요리하는 부분을 거의 편집하지않고 넣었어요~
그래서 그런지 예전영상대비 요리하는 부분이 
거의 2배 가까이 길어진것같아요 ㅎㅎ
(중간중간 오래전에 업로드한 영상이 나올텐데 좀 
짧고 편집도 뭔가 서툰게 보이네요ㅋㅋㅋ)
 
※ 요리할때 사용한 노란색(?) 가루는 설탕이에요🤣
