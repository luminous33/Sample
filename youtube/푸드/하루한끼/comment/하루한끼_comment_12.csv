My parents loved it, especially my dad. He said it was a 9/10.
I was also very pleased with the result as it was my first time cooking. 
However, I did make a slight mistake; I didn't whisk the egg whites for long enough (we don't have a whisk at home) and so it wasn't as fluffy as it was in the video but nonetheless, my parents approved!
So, thank you for sharing this simple recipe with us.
I highly recommend this to anyone who is thinking of trying it out. Just be ready for some arms workout, especially if you don't have a whisk.",3개
