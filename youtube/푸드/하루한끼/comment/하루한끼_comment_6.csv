6,taylorly,"i just made it and it’s tastes really good! definitely like caramel popcorn. i also have some tips for some of you guys who want to try it.

1. be patient when frying the bread, i kept stirring it around and was impatient. i also took it out a little early so it wasn’t as crunchy as i wanted it to be. if you want to save some time, just pop 2 slices in the toaster and it should be around the same.

2. when making the caramel sauce, melt the sugar all the way. i noticed even when my sauce looked like the one in the video, there was still sugar and when i mixed in the bread, there seemed to be some large pieces of sugar that didn’t melt.

edit: okay so i made them a second time today but instead of frying the bread, i popped them in the toaster, up but when making the caramel, i realized the pan was hot enough so it’s probably best if you fry the bread instead of putting them in the toaster

anyways, hope you found this helpful and good luck!",242개

at first try, i didnt wait the sugar to caramalize (turn it brown)and its so watery and makes the bread soggy and so sweett x/  it taste like i dip it into sugar water.

i use bun(just one bun)instead of breads cuz i out of bread.

i didnt know if i should use bakinh spoon measurement or just normal spoon, at the end, i use baking spoons (TBS) cuz at least the amount of liquid i use are balance.


it really is delicious. i even got the crunchy sound. and its not too sweet.
